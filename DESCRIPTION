Title: VariantScan: a Machine Leaning Tool for Variant Association Testing
Description: VariantScan provides a set of machine learning methods for variant (biomarkers, e.g.,genOmic (genetic loci), transcriptOmic (gene expressions), epigenOmic (methylations), proteOmic(proteins), metabolOmic (metabolites))
             association testing. The genome-wide signal scanning, including association testing can be implemented via least square (linear) model. However, the power might lose when it is applied to other omic data.  
             This packages integrates three methods, Linear Model, Local Polynomial Fitting (Nonlinear Model) and Generalized Additive Model to perform association testing in genome wide scan studies. 
             This packge also applies to case-control studies, where the ROC is used to access the model performance.
